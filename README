Kalles Fraktaler 2
fork for cross-compilation to win64 from linux mingw64, using GMP

upstream version
http://www.chillheimer.de/kallesfraktaler/

this version
https://mathr.co.uk/kf/kf.html

known bugs
- newton-raphson zooming to minibrot doesn't increase maxiters enough sometimes

configuration (COMPILE_FLAGS in Makefile)
- add -DKF_THREADED_REFERENCE_EVENT to use original threaded reference
  calculations (too much overhead in WINE to make it worthwhile, except at very
  deep zooms)
- add -DKF_THREADED_REFERENCE_BARRIER to use barrier() threaded reference
  (acceptable overhead in WINE, CPU affinity is adjusted with zoom depth,
  enabled by default)
