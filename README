Kalles Fraktaler 2
fork for cross-compilation to win64 from linux mingw64, using GMP

upstream version
http://www.chillheimer.de/kallesfraktaler/

this version
https://mathr.co.uk/kf/kf.html

known bugs
- newton-raphson zooming to minibrot doesn't increase maxiters enough sometimes

configuration (COMPILE_FLAGS in Makefile)
- add -DKF_FLOAT_BACKEND_CUSTOM to use original custom arbitrary precision code
- add -DKF_FLOAT_BACKEND_MPFR to use MPFR instead of GMP
- add -DKF_LONG_DOUBLE_DLL to compile long double support into separate DLL
  instead of building it into the executable itself; also remove LDBL_SOURCES
  from SOURCES_CPP
- add -DKF_THREADED_REFERENCE to use original threaded reference calculations
  (too much overhead to make it worthwhile, except possibly at very deep zooms)
